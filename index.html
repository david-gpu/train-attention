  <h1>Train your attention</h1>

  <p>Once you click the Start button below you will hear a meditation bell and rain drumming in the background.
  Gently place your attention on the sound of the rain pouring down.</p>

  <p>After a little while the rain will become noticeably quieter. This is your cue to press the space bar to show that
  you are still paying attention. It's that simple. The meditation session will come to an end when you miss the cue or press a key
  too early.</p>

  <p>If during the session you notice your mind starts to wander, don't feel bad. You did nothing wrong. Calmly bring your
  attention back to the sound of the rain, like a bumblebee that strayed away from the flowers and now decides to come back.</p>

  <p>Ready?</p>
